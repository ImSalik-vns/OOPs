/* Inheritance

Inheritance is when a class (or more than one classes) inherits the attributes and methods of
another class. The class that is inherited is called parent, super or inherited class.
The class that inherits is called child or sub-class.

/* There are five types of inheritance;
1. Single or simple inheritance.
2. Multi-level inheritance.
3. Hierarichal inheritance.
4. Multiple inheritance.
5. Hybrid inheritance.

Single or simple inheritance:
When there is a parent class with only one child class, it is called simple inheritance.

Multi-level inheritance:
When inheritance goes in this fashion; grandParent class -> parent class -> grandChild class,
it is called Multi-level inheritance.

Hierarichal inheritance:
When there are more than one child classes inherint a single parent class, it is called
Hierarichal inheritance.

Multiple inheritance:
When one child class inherits Multiple parent classes, it is called Multiple inheritance.
This one can be achieved only by uning interface classes.

Hybrid inheritance:
This is a hybrid of Hierarichal and Multiple inheritance. This isn't used in Java.
